<h1>EAAI Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge:<br />AI for Accessibility in Communication</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Challenge Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>purpose of the mentored undergraduate research challenge</b> is to provide undergraduate students exposure to the <i>complete research life-cycle</i> through the guidance of a mentor familiar with the research life-cycle.  The research life-cycle includes all the steps from identifying a problem, to hypothesizing solutions, to implementation and experimentation, to ultimately reporting results in a written publication.</li>
  <li>Participating teams will submit a manuscript of their research project for peer review at the EAAI-24 Symposium, which is collocated with AAAI-24.  Teams with accepted papers will have their submission published and presented at the EAAI-24 Symposium.</li>
  <li>Research challenge teams must include:
    <ul>
      <li>At least one undergraduate (including community college) student,</li>
      <li>At least one mentor (faculty or with a Ph.D.),</li>
      <li>Anyone else, but the undergraduate student <i>must</i> be involved in the majority of the research and the mentor <i>must</i> provide regular guidance to the team.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The <b>objective of this year's challenge</b> is to perform and publish research on AI for accessbility in communication.  The project should be doable within one semester or summer---be sure to keep the project simple and doable, addressing a single question if your problem is large.  There are many possible projects in this understudied area of research; some examples include, but are not limited to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices that generate information on behalf of people with trouble speaking, typing, or communicating,</li>
    <li>Present information to people who are visually and/or hearing impaired,</li>
    <li>Translate content (with respect to language and/or culture) for others to understand it,</li>
    <li>Showcase content creators' works to interested persons who might not find it normally,</li>
    <li>Effective communication of ideas, such as summarizing documents or addressing buzzwords,</li>
    <li>And more! Check out <a href="#projectideas">Project Ideas</a> below to get some inspiration.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>An introduction to this year's challenge can be found in an upcoming arXiv preprint.<!--: "<a href="aimatters_murc23_preprint.pdf">2023 EAAI Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge: Human-Aware AI in Sound and Music</a>"--></li>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a team who is <i>interested</i> in participating, then please contact <a href="https://www.sift.net/staff/richard-freedman">Rick Freedman</a> (rfreedman at sift dot net) with:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Team member names,</li>
    <li>Team member e-mail addresses, and </li>
    <li>Note who are the undergraduate(s) and mentor(s) on the team.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Why register your team?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-commital: registration is not a requirement to participate, but it lets the organizers know your team is considering participation.</li>
    <li>"Customer service": if your team has any questions about the challenge, then we can do our best to answer them.</li>
    <li>Updates: we can send teams updates about the challenge, including new resources, timeline changes, and deadline reminders.</li>
    <li>Program committee: to provide peer reviews to all submissions, we need to form a program committee of researchers familiar with undergraduate research.  If we can estimate the number of submissions, then we can make sure our program committee is large enough to avoid reviewing delays.  It would be appreciated, <i>but not required</i>, if team mentors are also willing to serve on the program committee and review other teams' submissions---there is <i>no conflict-of-interest</i> because this is a challenge for undergraduates to experience the complete research life-cycle, not a competition for the best research.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility-Related</h3>
<p>The challenge this year involves making technologies accessible.  However, teams with a focus in artificial intelligence are not expected to have a background in accessibility.  To learn about accessibility concepts for the challenge, here are some basic resources to get started.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, talk to subject matter experts and members of your target audience. <i>Research includes learning about your problem, not just solving it!</i> Informational interviews and focus groups can provide insights and feedback for your research efforts. You can read about people's experiences and expertise for additional background:
    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/aac/">Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)</a> article by <i>The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)</i>, which introduces many forms of AAC and explains the benefits of interacting with a speech-language pathologist (SLP).</li>
    </ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility">AI for Accessibility</a> webpage by <i>Microsoft</i> contains many resources, applications, examples, and funding opportunities.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion</a> articles by <i>The World Wide Web Consortium</i>, which discuss the many ways that content on the internet need to be accessible and why they matter.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.illegallysighted.com/">IllegallySighted</a> webpage by <i>Jesse Anderson</i> provides resources and insights about accessibility for technology (especially videogame-related tech).</li>
  <li>If your team plans to approach accessibility through broadening reach between communities, then be sure to consider the importance of understanding both groups.  Translation is not as simple as converting words between languages:
    <ul>
      <li>Trivedi, Harish. "<a href="https://iwp.uiowa.edu/91st/vol4-num1/translating-culture-vs-cultural-translation">Translating Culture Vs. Cultural Translation</a>." In <i>91st Meridian</i>, Volume 4, Number 1, 2005.</li>
      <li><a href="https://aldacenter.org/">The Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science</a> notes that even if the language might be the same, scientists need to be mindful of others when explaining their research and other scientific concepts. A few strategies are listed on their <a href="https://aldacenter.org/professional-development/foundational_programs.php">Foundational Science Communication Programs</a> webpage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="projectideas"><h3>Project Ideas</h3></a>
<p>Far from a complete list of things a team could research, but the first step in the research life-cycle is to observe the world and come up with some questions you want to answer. Check out the videos below for some related research projects and video-inspired questions to get started brainstorming. What will your team investigate?</p>
<ul>
  <li>For which of these 10 web accessibility perspectives can AI play a facilitating role?<br /> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3f31oufqFSM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
  <li>Verbal Victor is a smartphone application developed at Wake Forest University that generates speech clips for communication when the user presses a button displaying the concept.
