<h1>Who Publishes Where?</h1>
Different fields of research have different venues for publication.  This can lead to confusion in interdisciplinary work since the two fields may have different aims when publishing.  Below you can find a list of how various fields of study publish.  If I am missing your field of study, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with how your field publishes, and I will gladly update this page.

<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<list>
<li><b>Conference Publications</b> - (Primary way) People present their findings at <i>peer-reviewed</i> conferences accompanied by a several-page publication.  All the publications are bundled together in a giant book called a conference proceedings.  Depending on the conference, people can either purchase or freely download a proceedings.  The paper is usually due a few days after the time the presenter submits his/her presentation abstract.</li>
<li><b>Journal Publications</b> - (Primary way) People present major findings in longer publications than those found in conference proceedings.  The peer-reviewed journals containing these publications are released several times each year.</li>
<li><b>Workshop Publications</b> - (Secondary way) Workshops are sessions held at conferences that specialize on a very specific focus.  Most attendees of the workshop are people whose research focus is the same as the research topic.  Researchers can present preliminary work that is related to the topic and publish a workshop paper.  This work is usually presented with the intent of introducing new ideas and getting feedback from peers in this specific research community.  Workshops colocated with well-known computer science conferences often have a peeer-review process.
<li><b>Extended Abstracts</b> - (Secondary way) As part of any conference or workshop in computer science, there is often the opportunity to submit shorter papers about late-breaking discoveries.  Sometimes, a peer-reviewers will deem a submission worthy of presentation regardless of the manuscript's acceptance decision.  In both cases, an extended abstract is typically a short, one-to-two-page publication included in the proceedings documenting these presentations.

<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<list>
<li><b>Journal Publications</b> - (Primary way) People present their findings in peer-reviewed journals that are published several times each year.  Since the work is highly theoretical, it can take six months or longer to review a publication and decide whether it can be published in the journal.</li>
</list>
<h3>Medicine</h3>
<list>
<li><b>Journal Publications</b> - (Primary way) People present their findings in peer-reviewed journals that are published several times each year.  Publications in medicinal journals can either be papers about recent research findings or reviews of other people's publications in recent issues (these reviews are often by invitation from the journal).</li>
<li><b>Abstracts</b> - (Secondary way) People present smaller and/or preliminary findings as abstracts that are printed in conference proceedings.  As the name implies, abstracts are single paragraphs summarizing the idea and findings.  A poster is usually presented at the conference to which the abstract is accepted.  Later work on such projects eventually leads to journal publications.</li>
